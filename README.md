# contactifier
Contactifier is a simple tweak for jailbroken ios devices. Basically what this tweak does is that it lets you see the contact info in your Messages app, next to typed phone number that is presented in your your address book. This tweak is developed for iOS 10, however it should work fine on iOS 9 too.

NOTE: Contactifier does not alter messages stored in your phone! It is just showing them with additional info.
